    <p class="about-description">
      For my Creative Coding Assessment, I was given the opportunity to develop a storytelling web application, with the freedom to choose a narrative that resonates with my passions. I chose to focus on the importance of building healthy habits and maintaining a balanced routineâ€”topics I deeply care about.
    </p>

    <p class="about-description">
      This project not only serves to educate others about the positive impact of consistent habits but also showcases the technical skills I have gained throughout the course. Using tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma, I have crafted an engaging and informative experience.
    </p>

    <p class="about-description">
      I would like to extend my gratitude to Koundinya Dhulipalla for providing invaluable insights and sharing thoughtful content that enriched my understanding and approach to this project.
